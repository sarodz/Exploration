# Flower

Side project, more to come. 

## Contents
* *helper*: Code I have used for assisting the project.
	* scrapper: Scrapes picture and prices of flowers and insterts to a local DB
	* content: Creates a table called content in a DB called  flowers
	* collect: target links
	
The code assumes a MySQL DB is running in the background and its password is provided in a file called 'configuration.py'.

I will (hopefully) provide a better organization in the future.
